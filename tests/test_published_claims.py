"""Layer 7: the numbers and quotes the documentation publishes.

Two documentation-correction passes in one day, on 2026-09-06, found the same
class of defect each time: a count, a position or a quoted output line that no
longer matched what the tool or the measurement actually produced. Re-reading
caught them; re-reading is not a control.

This is the checkable half of that, turned into a test. It reads the published
files and asserts they agree with each other and with the scripts. It cannot
check prose, and it deliberately does not try: what it covers is exactly the
part where a human re-read is wasted effort.

No glibc clone needed -- everything here is in the repository.
